# Speaker Notes - Audio (2025-01-05)

1) Open with goal: zero engine core changes, external FMOD module.
2) Emphasize component binding: only XMFLOAT3 refs needed.
3) Explain update order: listener first, sources next, AudioSystem.Update last.
4) Demo steps: move camera, confirm attenuation, play one-shot.
5) Close with integration promise: GameApp OnInitialize/OnUpdate only.

Use the Korean report section at the end of the slides when addressing each teammate.
